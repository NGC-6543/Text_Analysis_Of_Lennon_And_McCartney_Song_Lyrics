Hot scalding tears I thought would flow.   Still in my heart they'll never show.   That day is done, that day is done,   You know where I've gone, I won't be coming back   That day is done.   Well I recall, the time and place   When they announced her precious face.   I thought at once my heart would burst,   Still, every time is like the first.   There was applause when she stepped up.   I wished that I could interrupt   I made no sign, I made no sound   I know I must stay underground.   That day is done, that day is done.   You know where I've gone, I won't be coming back,   That day is done.   That's why she walks, or so they say.   She always knew just what I needed   Now if she would, just look my way   One time before they proceed.   She sprinkles flowers in the dirt   That's when a thrill becomes a hurt,   I know I'll never see her face.   She walks away from my resting place.   That day is done, that day is done.

I'll always be in your mind.   Dreams of the future,   Ghosts of the past left behind.   Women's chorus   Ah   Shanty   Thought I had a vision   Lying in a graveyard,   Thought I heard a melody inside.   Could it be the future,   Speaking with the voice of those who died?   Thought I saw a kingdom,   Happiness and laughter,   Somewhere for an innocent to play.   Is there any justice?   Do these things still happen in this way?   Mary dee   Don't tell him no,   It isn't fair.   For he was told by those who know   There was love everywhere.   Shanty   Love everywhere.   Mary dee   Now's the time to tell him,   While his mother's crying.   Break it to him gently as she weeps.   Let him know his father   Will be well looked after, where he sleeps.

I swear   I'll never go through another of those things   In my life.   You should have warned me Of all the dangers.   But maybe there were some things you just didn't know.   But you're my father,   And surely fathers ought to know about most things   In this life.   Don't tell me.   I thought you were the best.   You were only human   And a lot like all the rest.

There's so much more to life than meets the eye,   It's quite enough to make a throat feel dry.   So let's repair   To where no one else would dare to bother us.   Let's have a drink   While we think what to do.   And while we think,   I'll accept a little drink from you.   If everybody took a serious view of life,   We all would feel the same as you.   But, as it is,   We don't, so it isn't gonna bother us.   Let's have a drink   While we think what to do.   And while we think,   I'll accept a little drink from you.
